## Notes

Took me a while to understand the kind of calls the API would bring in so I had to read the docs throughly. Experimented with postman to be able to see what kind of capabilites I had when calling the API. Overall was a nice project I really liked it and will most likely come back to edit this project to tailor more towards dietarty restrictions.
